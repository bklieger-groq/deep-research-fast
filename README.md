[Demo of Deep Research Fast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/068948df-0960-4beb-adea-2a561c69ed9e)
> Imagine deep research, spanning 50+ sources, taking 10 seconds. This is possible, only on Groq. Using multiple compound-beta-mini agents in parallel, Deep Research Fast achieves record speeds while producing comprehensive research reports.

## Features

- **Compound Agent Architecture**: Multiple mini agents working independently, before results are combined
- **Multimodal Results**: Text, links, and images are all returned in the report
- **Lightning Fast**: Research reports generated in seconds, not minutes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access to an average of 40-60 sources for thorough research
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface for seamless research experience
